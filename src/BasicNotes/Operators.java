    (operand) operator (operand) operator (operand)

    These operators are used to assign values to a variable. The left side operand of the assignment operator
    is a variable, and the right side operand of the assignment operator is a value. The value on the right side
    must be of the same data type of the operand on the left side. Otherwise, the compiler will raise an error.
    This means that the assignment operators have right to left associativity, i.e., the value given on the right-hand
    side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left. Therefore, the right-hand side value must
    be declared before using it or should be a constant. -GeeksForGeeks
