    When instantiating an object like this:
    Dog doggy = new Dog();
    You are in a sense writing:
    Class/variableType variableName = new objectOfAClass/ObjectType();
    Where the new object is being instantiated by a constructor with the same name as the class.
    That means that the variableType depicts what we can call on the variableName, while the ObjectType
    tells us what will actually happen.
